`NICE Tools`
=======================================================

Get the latest code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get the latest code using git, simply type::

    git clone git://github.com/nice-tools/nice.git

If you don't have git installed, you can download a zip or tarball
of the latest code: https://github.com/nice-tools/nice/archives/master

Install nice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As any Python packages, to install NICE, go in the nice source
code directory and do::

    python setup.py install

or if you don't have admin access to your python setup (permission denied
when install) use::

    python setup.py install --user

You can also install the latest latest development version with pip::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/nice-tools/nice#egg=nice-dev --user

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The required dependencies to build the software are:
* python >= 2.7 | python >= 3.4
* scipy >= 0.18.1
* numpy >= 1.11.1
* h5py >= 2.6.0

And principally, mne-python >= 0.20:
http://mne-tools.github.io/stable/index.html


Some functions require pandas >= 0.7.3.

To run the tests you will also need nose >= 0.10.

Optimizations (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Aditionally, we ship optimized versions of some algorithms.
They can be compiled using the conda CLANG and openmp.
Both can be installed as follows::

    conda install clang
    conda install openmp


To build, go to the nice soure code directory and do::

    CC=clang make

Then set backend='c' or 'openmp' instead of the defalut backend='python' in markers functions

If running on osx 10.15, then you might face this error::

    /anaconda3/include/python3.7m/Python.h:25:10: fatal error: 'stdio.h' file not found

Running this command will fix it::

    sudo ln -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/* /usr/local/include/


Running the test suite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the test suite, you need nosetests and the coverage modules.
Run the test suite using::

    nosetests

from the root of the project.
