    Parameters
    ----------
    epochs : instance of Epochs
        The input data.
    tmin : float | None
        The first time point to include, if None, all samples form the first
        sample of the epoch will be used. Defaults to None.
    tmax : float | None
        The last time point to include, if None, all samples up to the last
        sample of the epoch wi  ll be used. Defaults to None.
    return_epochs : bool
        Whether to compute an average or not. If False, data will be
        averaged and put in an Evoked object. Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    cnv : ndarray of float (n_channels, n_epochs) | instance of Evoked
        The regression slopes (betas) represewnting contingent negative
        variation.
